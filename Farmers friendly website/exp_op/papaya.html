<ul>
<li>Papaya crops need a high level of humidity and temperature. It is sensitive to frost and heavy rains can cause damage. </li>
<br>
<li>Papaya can grow in a variety of soils. However, a rich, sandy loam is ideal for papaya plantation. It can also grow well in alluvial soil. </li>
<br>
<li>Papaya is planted during monsoon, autumn and spring season. It is not planted during winter as the frost can cause damage  to the crop. </li>
<br> 
<li>A young papaya plant would need more moisture than the older trees. This is because older trees have slower vegetative growth.</li>
<br>
<li>Hence the seedlings are irrigated once or twice a week while fruit bearing trees need irrigation once in every 15 days.</li>
